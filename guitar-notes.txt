A musical key: a group of chords and scales which work together.

# How Do I Work Out a Musical Key?

Step 1) Look At The First And Last ChordThe easiest way to work the musical key of a song, is to check the first and last chord in a progression.Here’s a classic chord progression:

G Major | C Major  |D Major  |G Major  |

The first and last chords in this progression are: G Major.

Therfore the chord progression is in the key of G.

99% of the time, this works for ANY key. If this doesn’t work, there are other methods you can try. Let’s look at some..

Step 2) Try A Major Scale Over That Chord Progression


Another way of working out a musical key is to play a scale over that chord progression to see whether it works.

For example, if you thought that a chord progression was in the key of C, but you weren’t 100% sure, you could try a C major scale over it to see if it would work.

If you hear any of the notes clashing with the chord progression, then it’s probably not the right key.

Step 3) Look At The Stave

If you want to get really geeky about working out musical keys. You can double check what the stave says at the side of a piece of music.

This is a little more complicated and takes a bit more work than just looking at the chords of a chord progression.

However, if you can understand this concept it will take your guitar playing to the next level.

# What’s The Difference Between Musical Keys And Guitar Keys?

There is actually NO difference between a musical key and a guitar key.

The reasons for this, is that the chords in this key are more suitable for the guitar.

You can play ANY key on the guitar, it’s just these specific keys are more guitar friendly than the others.

# Understanding The Fundamentals Of Guitar Leys

Before we can learn about what chords are in each key. It’s very important that we understand a few fundamentals first.

# You Must Know The Notes On The E And A Strings

It’s important to understand these notes as they will help you to develop your fretboard knowledge and allow you to play any chord all across the fretboard.

Some chords are not accessible in an open position, so if you know what the note names are, you can use barre chords to help you gain access to the rest of the fret board.

Eventually it would be awesome if you could know where all the notes on the fret board are.

You don’t have to know EVERY note on the fret board if you’re a beginner. For now, focus on the E (6th string) and A string. (5th string.)

# Learning The Chords In A Guitar Key


Each musical key is only ever going to have:

- 3 major chords
- 3 Minor chords
- 1 diminished chord

You can forget about the diminished chord for now. Just know that a musical key will only ever have 3 major and minor chords.

# Each Chord Is Built Off Of Each Degree Of The Scale

The scales we’re dealing with today, have 7 notes in them.

DISCLAIMER! There are other scales which have more notes but don’t worry about them for now.

For now, let’s keep it nice and simple and work this out in the key of C major.

Here are the notes in a C major scale.

For every note in the scale, this represents a chord. Your formula for the scale will ALWAYS be:

1. Major
2. Minor
3. Minor
4. Major
5. Major
6. Minor
7. Diminished

For every note in the scale, the:

- 1st, 4th and 5th notes in the scale represent major chords.
- The 2nd 3rd and 6th notes in the scale represent minor chords.
- And the 7th note in the scale represents a diminished chord.

This will NOT change! This may seem like a little bit much right now, however there is a really easy way to work out the chords for all guitar keys.

Step 1) Find The Root Note

In this case it’s C, so your root note will be on the 8th fret of the low E string. (6th string.)


Step 2) Go Across A String

So here, you’ll be going to the 8th fret of the A string. (5th string.) This is where your 4 chord is, in the key of C major that’s the F chord.

Step 3) Go Up Two Frets

Now, you’re moving up to the 10th fret, this note is a G. This is the 5th note in the scale, and therefore the ‘G major’ chord.

For the first 3 steps, we have found every single major chord in our musical key.

Step 4) To Find Your Minor Chords, Move Down 3 Fret

Go back to the root note and then move down 3 frets.

This takes you to the 5th fret, this is your 6th note of the major scale. In this case, the 6th note in a C major scale is ‘A’. Therefore, that chord is the A minor chord.

Step 5) Repeat Steps 2 And 3

Make sure when you do this, that you do it FROM the 6th note in the scale.

If you’ve followed the steps correctly, you should have played a D minor (2nd chord) on the 5th fret of the A string, and a E minor chord (3rd chord) on the 7th fret of the A string.

This only works if you use the appropriate major and minor barre chord shapes on each string.Learn barre chords here: 3 Tips For Clean and Easy Barre Chords: https://nationalguitaracademy.com/3-barre-chords-tips-nwm/

This works in any key, all you need to do is find the right root note for each string. The most common keys in music are C, G, D, A and E. Let’s learn more about these fundamental keys.



Chords are split into two levels: triads and seven's.


Triad has 5 keys: C, A, G, E, D


Everything can be drived from the C key.


Think about root note first



Start from Am, and find B's 


Am: A, C, E

O|---|---|---|---|---| E b5
 |-1-|---|---|---|---|	C b3
 |---|-3-|---|---|---| A 1
 |---|-2-|---|---|---| E b5
O|---|---|---|---|---| A 1
X|---|---|---|---|---| X


Start with playing Am, 
you move half a step (bar 1st fret), Bbm
you move half a step (bar 2nd fret), Bm
you move half a step (bar 3nd fret), Cm
you move half a step (bar 4nd fret), C#m/Dbm
you move half a step (bar 5nd fret), Dm
you move half a step (bar 6nd fret), D#m/Ebm
you move half a step (bar 7nd fret), Em
you move half a step (bar 8nd fret), Fm
you move half a step (bar 9nd fret), F#m/Gbm
you move half a step (bar 10nd fret), Gm
you move half a step (bar 11nd fret), G#m/Abm
you move half a step (bar 12nd fret), Am
